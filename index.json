This was done as a part of Seasons of Code (SOC) organised by Web and Coding Club (WnCC), IIT Bombay. I co-ordinated in a team of 8, to build a real-time system that monitors network traffic for malicious activity. This was done with the help of raw network packet sniffer with a machine learning model detecting threats in the background.\n  Block diagram of IDS.  My Contributions:  My major work was related to supervising the first year students and building a machine learning model to detect threats. For this, I read many reasearch papers to find out which type of model performs best and which dataset to use. We finally chose CICIDS2017 dataset as this was quite recent and relevant. I then applied Pearson Correlation and Chi-square test to this dataset to select best 15 out of 81 features. I trained the chosen features with an ensemble model (consisting of classifiers such as Random-Forest, ExtraTrees, KNN, etc.) to achieve around 99% accuracy but the model was slow in making predictions and was practically not possible to use it. Then I trained with each of the classifiers and found that KNN and ExtraTrees gave that accuracy to the ensemble model and the delay was mainly because of KNN. Finally using ExtraTrees classifier, I achieved an accuracy of 99.7%, and with greatly reduced inference time.
