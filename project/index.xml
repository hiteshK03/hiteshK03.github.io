      <title>Pneumonia Detection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In summer 2020, when the whole world was caught in a pandemic, I hopefully landed an internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.endimension.com/#/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Endimension Technology Pvt Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;, a healthcare Aritificial Intelligence startup incubated at IIT Bombay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem Statement:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To classify if a patient has pneumonia or not, and if he/she has then to detect regions of fluid in the chest X-rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset consisted of images of chest X-rays of Indian patients in different formats such as Dicom, NifTI, jpg, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview of work done:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, first of all, had to build a pre-processing pipeline to feed images of different formats and different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented a tensorflow model and experimented and optimized different object detection models and ensembled them to improve metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my one month work, I achieved sensitivity and specificity of more than 90% on the test dataset, consisting of over 3000 images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note : The actual deep learning architecture used is confidential as per company policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intrusion Detection System</title>
      <link>https://hiteshK03.github.io/project/ids/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 19:55:58 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hiteshK03.github.io/project/ids/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project started at the time when everyone was shut in their homes, owing to the worldwide pandemic. This was done as a part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wncc-iitb.org/soc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Seasons of Code (SOC)&lt;/a&gt; organised by Web and Coding Club (WnCC), IIT Bombay. I co-ordinated in a team of 8, to build a real-time system that monitors network traffic for malicious activity. This was done with the help of raw network packet sniffer with a machine learning model detecting threats in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Block diagram of IDS.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=contribution&gt;My Contributions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My major work was related to supervising the first year students and building a machine learning model to detect threats. For this, I read many reasearch papers to find out which type of model performs best and which dataset to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We finally chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CICIDS2017&lt;/a&gt; dataset as this was quite recent and relevant. I then applied Pearson Correlation and Chi-square test to this dataset to select best 15 out of 81 features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I trained the chosen features with an ensemble model (consisting of classifiers such as Random-Forest, ExtraTrees, KNN, etc.) to achieve around 99% accuracy but the model was slow in making predictions and was practically not possible to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I trained with each of the classifiers and found that KNN and ExtraTrees gave that accuracy to the ensemble model and the delay was mainly because of KNN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally using ExtraTrees classifier, I achieved an accuracy of 99.7%, and with greatly reduced inference time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Self Driving Car</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umiciitb.com/competitions/SeDriCa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Team SeDriCa&lt;/a&gt; consisting of around 20 members. We were one of the 11 finalists among 289 teams competing in the Mahindra RISE Driverless Car Challenge to build India&#39;s first self driving car targeting the level 5 autonomy and received a Mahindra E2O for development of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In my initial months, I was mainly understanding and implementing models in the computer vision subsytem, training Traffic Sign and Traffic Light classifier based on Resnet-50 and Resnet-152 architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I, then switched to handle Path Planning and Decision Making subsytem as CV modules were giving decent results. I went for on-ground testing of the vehicle (in the campus) and optimized the path of the vehicle accounting for the location and information of obstacles and traffic signals using Robot Operating System (ROS).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of my major contribution in this subsytem was implementing RRT* algorithm and integrating with other modules through ROS, to improve the speed and accuracy of finding path which was previously using Hybrid-A*.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ASME SDC 2019</title>
      <link>https://hiteshK03.github.io/project/asme/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:55:58 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my freshmen year, I was recruited in the tech team &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umiciitb.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Unmesh Mashruwala Innovation Cell&lt;/a&gt; along with 10 other freshmen and our first project was the competition &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umiciitb.com/competitions/ASME&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#34;Student Design Challenge&#34;&lt;/a&gt; organised every year by American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
The competition required us to build a remote controlled bot of maximum dimensions 50x50, capable of picking, storing and placing balls of sizes ranging from table-tennis balls to as large as basket balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;deepu_bot.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deepu_bot.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our bot, which we named &#34;Deepu&#34;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learnings&#34;&gt;My Contributions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmed Roboteq to control the encoder-geared DC motors used to rotate the mechanum wheels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmed arduino to simultaneously control a stepper and 2 servo motors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlled the whole bot using transmitter during testing phase to improve speed and accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code used for the competition is available 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hiteshK03/ASME-SDC-Competition&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learnings&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working hard for 3 months, we flew to Vellore for the Aisa-Pacific Regionals to compete with 20 other colleges from all over Asia. After 3 days of planning strategies and sleepless nights, we finally emerged as the Overall Winners of the Asia-Pacific Regionals. With this we qualified to represent India at the World Finals at Utah, USA in Nov 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some posts on our victory can be found
