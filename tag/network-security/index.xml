      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project started at the time when everyone was shut in their homes, owing to the worldwide pandemic. This was done as a part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wncc-iitb.org/soc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Seasons of Code (SOC)&lt;/a&gt; organised by Web and Coding Club (WnCC), IIT Bombay. I co-ordinated in a team of 8, to build a real-time system that monitors network traffic for malicious activity. This was done with the help of raw network packet sniffer with a machine learning model detecting threats in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=contribution&gt;My Contributions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My major work was related to supervising the first year students and building a machine learning model to detect threats. For this, I read many reasearch papers to find out which type of model performs best and which dataset to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We finally chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CICIDS2017&lt;/a&gt; dataset as this was quite recent and relevant. I then applied Pearson Correlation and Chi-square test to this dataset to select best 15 out of 81 features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I trained the chosen features with an ensemble model (consisting of classifiers such as Random-Forest, ExtraTrees, KNN, etc.) to achieve around 99% accuracy but the model was slow in making predictions and was practically not possible to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I trained with each of the classifiers and found that KNN and ExtraTrees gave that accuracy to the ensemble model and the delay was mainly because of KNN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally using ExtraTrees classifier, I achieved an accuracy of 99.7%, and with greatly reduced inference time.&lt;/li&gt;
